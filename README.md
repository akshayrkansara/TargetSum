Random number generation and summation is working fine. I have added 2 different projects. Working project has the random number generation and addition which works fine, it has three states won , lost and playing which works fine. Target sum project has random number generation, sum of numbers and the timer decrementing from '10'. Also have added the code for connection to firebase database but commented out due to some errors it is not working.
